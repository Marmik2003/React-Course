By now, we have a function Form Builder with which we can manage a number of forms.

For this milestone you need to
 - Create a Preview Page that takes a user through each question like a Quiz, one at a time.
 - In the preview page, each question would have a unique URL, so that it is possible to share a specific question of a quiz as a URL.
 - Configure the router such that each quiz would have a public link for previewing it. `/preview/:formId`
 - Remove the `input` fields from the Form Builder Screen at `/form/:formId` and make the label of each question editable instead.

<!-- Add a video demo of the expected output -->
### Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is well-formatted. Unformatted code will be rejected without review. To format your code, you can use Prettier. When submitting, attach a link to the exact folder in your Github repo with the App.tsx file.
2. All links within the App should use `<Link>` instead of `<a>` tags.
