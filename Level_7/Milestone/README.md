Through this Level we have seen how to work with APIs and how to manage our authentication token using localStorage. Our App is half-baked at this point since we have not integrated formFields APIs to create and manage fields in the forms

For this milestone, you need to

 - Integrate the APIs for the forms and formFields APIs referring to the Swagger Documentation
 - Integrate the APIs for Submissions and Answers referring to the Swagger Documentation
 - Separate the Routes based on authentication. (Creating and Editing Forms Should not be accessible to unauthenticated users)

### Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is well-formatted. Unformatted code will be rejected without review. To format your code, you can use Prettier. When submitting, attach a link to the exact folder in your Github repo with the App.tsx file.
2. Make sure that the app builds with no warnings in the console.
