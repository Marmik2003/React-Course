Now that we've created a dynamic list, let's use an `<input>` text field to collect user input.

First of, let's create an input tag to let the user type in the name of the item they want to add to the list.

```jsx
  <input />
```

Now how do we get the text the user typed in? We can use the `onChange` event handler to do this. So let's add an event handler to the `<input>` tag. So let's create a new state variable called `inputText` and also make a handleChange function that takes the value from the input field and sets the state variable to that value.

```jsx
  <input onChange={handleChange} />
```

```jsx
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState('');
  const handleChange = (e: any) => {
    setInput(e.target.value);
  };
```


And now we can use the `<input>` to collect user input. Let's try to understand how this works. You can see that the `<input>` has an onChange event handler. This event handler is called whenever the user types something in the input field. This returns an event object. We can use the `target` property of the event object to get the value of the input field. This value is stored in the `input` state and is later used to create a new item in the list.
