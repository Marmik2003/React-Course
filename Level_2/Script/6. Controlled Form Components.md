At the end of the last lesson we saw that clearing the state doesn't seem to be clearing the input text. The input text is still there. This is because this input field is not yet a controlled element. In order to make it a controlled element, we need to add a `value` attribute to the input element. The `value` attribute is a string that represents the current value of the input field. If we can wire the `value` attribute to a state variable, we can make this input field a controlled element.

```jsx
    <input value={input} onChange={handleChange} />
```

Now you can see that we are able to modify the input text from our code. This is now a controlled element. Let's try to create an additional field to each item so that we can mark items as done.
