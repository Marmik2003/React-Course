Now that you've seen how to use state, let's look at how to use state to build dynamic components. State is a powerful tool for building dynamic components. You can build components with one or more state variables, and the state variables can be used to dynamically change the content of the component.

For Instance you could make a simple list of items where the user can add a new item using a button.

We can create a state variable to track the list of items.
```js
  const [items, setItems] = useState<string[]>(["item 1", "item 2"]);
```

And we can map the array of items to a list of <li> elements.
```js
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
```

How about adding more items to the list? We can create a button and point the onClick event to add a new item to the list.

```js
  const addItem = () => {
    setItems([...items, "new item"]);
  };
```

That's it! You've created a simple list of items. Now you can add a new item by clicking the button. Now how about we add another button to remove items? You can create a button for each item in the list and point the onClick event to remove the item from the list.

```js
  const removeItem = (index: number) => {
    setItems(items.filter((item, i) => i !== index));
  };
```

That's it! Now you can remove items by clicking the remove button. Next up, in the next lesson, we'll let the user type in a new item and add it to the list.
