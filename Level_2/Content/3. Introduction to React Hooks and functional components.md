# Introduction to React Hooks and Functional components

In the last lessons, we learned about class based components. Going forward we will be using functional components. Functional components are a bit more concise and easier to read.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The above example shows an uncontrolled functional React component. So how do we make it controlled? Or how do we use State in a functional component? 

This is where React Hooks come in. React Hooks are a set of new features that allow us to write functional components that are easier to read and easier to understand. In order to use State inside a functional component, we have the useState hook.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

That looks a lot more simpler than the class based example we saw for Creating a counter right! We'll be using functional components and React Hooks in this course. The state can be anything from a simple counter to a complex object, we'll learn more about that in the upcoming lessons.
