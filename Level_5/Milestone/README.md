In this level we've done a quick Recap through how we have used Types till now, and then learned how we can build our own types that best fit our App. We now have two types of Form Fields, which are Dropdowns and Text Fields.

For this milestone, you need to
 - Make the App capable of handling Different types of inputs such as Long Text inputs, Single Choice inputs, Multi Choice inputs, Number inputs, etc.
 - You will have to make discriminated union types for the new form fields.
 - You will have to modify our Dropdown creation to allow custom options as well as the ability to edit them after creating the field
 - Create an extra custom form field of your own for brownie points :)

### Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is well-formatted. Unformatted code will be rejected without review. To format your code, you can use Prettier. When submitting, attach a link to the exact folder in your Github repo with the App.tsx file.
2. Make sure that the app builds with no warnings in the console.
3. Update the Preview Page to reflect the new fields you've added.
