Like we've seen in the previous lesson, our React App compiles to merely a HTML file with a JS Script on it. This means that you don't need a server to publish your app to the web. You just need a service that can host these files. There are a lot of services that you could use to do this. Some of these are 
    - Netlify
    - Github Pages
    - Vercel
    - Amazon S3 etc..
  
In this lesson, we'll learn to deploy using Netlify since it's a free service and probably the easiest to setup.

The instructions are very simple, login to your Netlify account, Add a New Site, Link your Github Repo and Click on Deploy! It's actually that simple! So let's go through this together. 

First let's head to Netlify and Sign Up. I'm gonna login with my Github account.
