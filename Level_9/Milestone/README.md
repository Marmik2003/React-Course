Through the previous lesson, we've seen how we can deploy our apps to the cloud

For this milestone,

1. Create an account on Netlify and Deploy your App.
2. Make your App a PWA (Progressive Web App).
3. Use Suspense/Lazy Loading to load the components asynchronously. To improve the performance of your app.
4. Setup a Sentry account and setup the Sentry integration.

### Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is well-formatted. Unformatted code will be rejected without review. To format your code, you can use Prettier. When submitting, attach a link to the exact folder in your Github repo with the App.tsx file.
2. Make sure that the app builds with no warnings in the console.
