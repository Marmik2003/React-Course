The useEffect Hook is a side effect hook that is similar to the lifecycle methods componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. But useEffect is a lot more concise. In functional components you can use multiple state variables. So when you're defining a useEffect, you can define it to fire when any or all of the state variables change.

The syntax for the uesEffect Hook looks like this:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // code to run when the component mounts
  return () => {
    // cleanup code
  };
}, [variable1, variable2]);
```

Here you can see that the first argument is a function adn the second argument is an array. Whenever the variables defined in the dependency array change, the useEffect function, ie. the first argument, will fire.

You can also define a useEffect with an empty array as the second argument. This will fire every time a component mounts for the first time.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // code to run when the component mounts
  return () => {
    // cleanup code
  };
}, []);
```

For instance if you want to run a timer, you could do something like this:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setTimer(timer => timer + 1);
  }, 1000);
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  };
}, []);
```
