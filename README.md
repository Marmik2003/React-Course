## Objective

This course aims at creating the builders of tomorrow, Along this course, we will try to explain the fundamentals of the single page web applications, and learn about typed functional . This course is designed to be hands-on with milestone targets at each level, the targets are designed to make you think and implement the concepts you have learned throughout the course.

## Course Outcomes

- Learn industry-standard practices for programming and product development
- Strengthen your understanding of Strongly Typed Languages.
- Gain an understanding of Single Page Applications.
- Fundamentals of React and Typescript.
- Understanding and Building a modern frontend application with the React Typescipt.
- Basics of Deploying SPAs to the Cloud.

## Skills Required

Basic knowledge of any programming language is required. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS is also Prefered but Not Required. A basic knowledge of JavaScript is also required.
This course assumes that you already have a development environment with a stable internet connection, Linux/Mac is preferred, Windows is not Preferred ( except Windows on WSL )
Fundamental Understanding of any backend framework is required. This is covered in the courses `Web Development 201` and `Web Development 202`. Above all, you need to have a strong will to learn new skills.


## Summary

In the React Typescript course, we'll start with an introduction to basic types in typescript, and then move on to creating a CRA App to start building react, we'll also take a look at React's Raw APIs and understand how React works. After you have a fair understanding of what React as a library work, you will start using the tools that React gives you such as React State, Effects etc.. 

After this we will learn to use routing in React, and how to use the router to render different components based on the URL. We will learn to refactor our application to mimic the behaviour of having multiple pages.

Once you've gotten comfortable with basic React in this regard, we will take a deeper dive into Typescript and understand how to Strongly type our application using Typescript. We will also learn about the Action Reducer pattern that helps us manage our state better.After this we will start using REST APIs and learn how to deal with the backend in a strongly typed fashion. We will also learn more about ARIA and how to use it to make our applications more accessible.

Through the above we will build a fully featured application that can be deployed to the cloud. We will learn to optimize our application for production use and deploy our application to the cloud using Netlify.

At the end of the course, you would be given a capstone project where you will apply all the skills you have learned throughout the course to build a fully functional web application.
