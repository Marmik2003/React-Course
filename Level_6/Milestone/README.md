Through this level, we've seen how to use Generics in TypeScript and how to use the `useReducer` hook to manage state following the Action Reducer Pattern. We have not refactored our entire app to use the `useReducer` hook at this point.

For this milestone you need to
1. Refactor the Preview Component's state to use the useReducer hook and the action reducer pattern.
2. Build a Discriminated Union Type to manage the different types of actions.

### Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is well-formatted. Unformatted code will be rejected without review. To format your code, you can use Prettier. When submitting, attach a link to the exact folder in your Github repo with the App.tsx file.
2. Make sure that the app builds with no warnings in the console.
