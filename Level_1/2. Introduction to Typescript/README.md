## Set Up the Typescript Compiler

You've already installed `node` to run javascript files. Similarlt to run typescript files, you'll need to install the type-script compiler first. You can simply run 

```
    npm install -g typescript
```

Once you have typescript installed you can run the compiler by typing

```
    tsc <file_name>
```

This woulc compile the `.ts` file giving you a `.js` file which you can run using `node` just like any other javascript file. You'll learn more about Typescript in-depth in later lessons.
