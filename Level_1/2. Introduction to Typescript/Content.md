# Why use Typescript?

Typescript Compiles to Javascript, therefore powering Javascript with the advantages of a compiled languages all the while allowing the use of Javascript's most powerful features.

Using Typescript allows you to write code that is more readable, easier to maintain and extend, especially when working with large projects. The compiler will help reduce the number of runtime errors and make it easier to debug the any errors that may occur.

It is considerably easier to refactor code when you have a compiled language, especially on large projects. The freedom of dynamic typing often leaves you with a lot of problems that can be avoided with a compiled language. 

You can avoid many of the common runtime errors that can occur with dynamic typing by using the compiler. Phantom errors like 'undefined is not a function' are are very common in Javascript.
