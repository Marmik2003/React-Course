Welcome to the first level of the course 301 React Typescript. This is an advanced level course. This is a level 3 course and you are expected to complete a level 2 course before you take this.

Through this course you will learn how build single page web apps in React Typescript and gain an understanding on how Front End Applications work in general 

Now in order to get started, let's setup a development environment for you to start your journey building React applications.

We recommend that you have a Linux or Mac System when you follow this course. If youâ€™re on a Windows System, we recommend you install WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) so that you have a Linux environment to work with. If this is the case, you can follow the instructions for linux throughout this course.

If you're running macOS, I assume that you have homebrew installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the following link: https://brew.sh/

I'll be using MacOS for this course.

## Install Git

First we need to install Git. You may have already installed it, in which case you can skip this step.

If you're on MacOS, you can run 

    brew install git

If you're on Linux or WSL, you can run 

    sudo apt-get install git

## Install Node

Next we need to install Node.js. 

If you're on MacOS, you can run 

    brew install node

    brew install npm

If you're on Linux or WSL, you might need to add the following to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_12.x bionic main

Then run 

    sudo apt-get update

Then run 

    sudo apt-get install nodejs


## Install IDE


The next step  would be to  install an IDE. We recommend you use Visual Studio Code or VS Code. but there are a lot of other options such as Atom, Sublime Text, and IntelliJ etc.

I would be using VS Code for this course.

To install VS Code you can head to VS Code's official website and download the latest version.

    https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Install Extensions

Next up, we need to install some extensions.

In VS Code we recommend you install the following extensions:

ESLint
ESLint-plugin-react
tailwind-intellisense

On your browser, you can install

React Dev Tools


## Epilogue

With that you should be ready to start building your first React application. See you in the next level!
