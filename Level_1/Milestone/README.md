Through the previous lesson we've created a React App using CRA, Created a UI using tailwind and generated a list of `<input>` tag from an array of objects

For all the input fields, that we've rendered, we've used a constant `type` property set to `text`

As part of this milestone, you need to update the `formFields` array to add 2 more fields `Date of Birth` and `Phone Number`. You should use a relavant type for these
