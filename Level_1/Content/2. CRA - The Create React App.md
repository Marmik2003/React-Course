# CRA - The Create React App

The Create React App is a tool that allows you to create a new React app with no build configuration. This allows you to quickly get started without working on a lot of configuration.

To start a project using the Create React App, you can use the following command:

    npx create-react-app my-app

This would create a new project called my-app. Now you can cd into the directory and run the app using the following commands:

    # cd into the directory
    cd my-app
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    # Run the app
    npm start

Now you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.
