# React Fragments

React Fragments are a way to group a list of elements into a single element or component. React needs every component to be the child of a single node, for example a <div>. But sometimes you might need to make a list of elements into a single element. This is where React Fragments come in. You can simply create a React Fragment and add the elements inside it.

Here's how you would typically wrap things in a div:
```
<div>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</div>
```

With React Fragments, you can do the same thing by wrapping the elements inside a React Fragment:

```
<React.Fragment>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</React.Fragment>
```
